DISCLAIMER: I take no responsibility for any problems this script causes to your device. I have completed the R&D on my own device and it works perfectly, but I cannot guarentee your device will be the same. If you do have issues, a factory reset should return the phone to its original state. BACK UP YOUR DATA before running this script.
